* Handle manual resolution of a conflict during "sync" operations

* Handle the absence of a sheet name in a file config.

  Should just default to using the first sheet in the spreadsheet
  (ie. index 0).

* Error handling when no spreadsheet requested
 * Allow one to be selected as a default?

* Avoid unnecessary format changes in upload/download sync
 * Use a new "prefer_format=A" option in csvmerge?

   Goal would be to avoid changing quoting etc. if the local file
   format does not match the google sheet but all data otherwise
   matches.
